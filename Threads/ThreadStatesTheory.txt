1. Every time you create a new thread that goes into a new state.

2. When you start a thread, it goes into the Runnable state.
        When the thread is executing and then it is waiting for the schedular, it is in a runnable state.
        
3. When the thread is actually running on a CPU, it is in a Running state.
        The thread executes with the help of the run() method in a running state.
        A thread goes in the running state only when it gets informed by the schedular to get executed.

4. The thread can be held with the help of the sleep() or wait() method, then will go into the waiting state.

5. With the use of notify() method, the thread goes to the Runnable state from the waiting state.

6. You can stop the execution of a thread by using a stop() method, and then it will go into the Dead State.
        When the work of a thread gets over, then it will go into the dead state automatically.
